# BUAA-Database-2018

**introduction**

This is a project for course 'Database', 2020, BUAA.

+ We designed and developed an online game mall where game developers could let the games on/off the shelf. Users  could review games, add the game to their favorite list, purchase games and make comments. Administrators could  delete comments, block illegal users and game developers.

+ Used the dataset triggers to improve the efficiency and token-based authentication to improve security
+ Used SQL-Alchemy to build the database, which contained nine tables and ten entities.

+ We used Flask and Python for back-end, and Vue for front-end.
